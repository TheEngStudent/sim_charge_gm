"""
This program used to copy over the re-simulated vehicle stop data, but has now been
repurposed to instead perform the same algorithm that ev-fleet-sim does. This used to 
save the files to the same directory as the folder_name.py

The program now calculates if the vehicle is stopped based on two parameters:
    -   is the vehicles velocity lower than 10 km/h - this can be considered as 
        stopping due to gps inaccuracy
    -   is the vehicle within a 20m radius of this stop location in the next instance
