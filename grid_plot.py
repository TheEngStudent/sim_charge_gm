This program reads the gid power data from the different scenarios and
performs various plotting functions on it. The program does the followinf 
tasks:
    First:
        - Find the minimum power for the hour of each day
        - Find the maximum power for the hour for each day
        - Find the average power for the hour over all the days
        - Plot this on one graph and fill the gap as an area
        - This is combined grid power
    Second:
        - Find the maximum power in each day
        - Plot according to number of chargers and different battery sizes
    Third:
        - Split the power graphs according to depot charging and home charging
        - Plot on the same graph with different colours
        - The same is done as in first
